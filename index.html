      <h4>note from Cecilia</h4>
      <p>This event is ladies and children only. Although I had hoped to make this a co-ed shower, I still wanted to be careful during this time as COVID-19 restrictions
      have just been lifted, and everyone's health is our top priority. Nonetheless, I’m looking forward to spending
      celebrating Leon’s fast-approaching arrival with the dear ladies and children in my life.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <h4>bring a book</h4>
      <p>One more request that we hope won’t be too hard,</p>
      <p>Please bring a book instead of a card.</p>
      <p>A favorite, like Cat in the Hat or Winnie the Pooh,</p>
      <p>Please sign the book with a note to Leon from you.</p>
      <p>Your book will be cherished whether it is well-loved or new.</p>
      <p>And each time we read it, he’ll be reminded of you.</p>
